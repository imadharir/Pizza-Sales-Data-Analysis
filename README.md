# Pizza Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales data using Power BI to generate insights on revenue, order trends, and pizza category performance. The data covers the period from January 2015 to December 2015, focusing on metrics like total revenue, number of pizzas sold, and average order values.

## Problem Statement

### Business Challenge:
A pizza chain is experiencing inconsistent sales performance across its various locations and needs better insights into its sales patterns. The management team is struggling to understand which factors contribute to the variation in pizza sales, such as:

- Which days and times generate the most sales?
- Which pizza categories and sizes perform best?
- Are there specific months where sales peak or decline?
- What are the top and bottom-selling pizzas, and how can the product mix be optimized?

Currently, decisions are being made based on intuition rather than data, resulting in lost opportunities for revenue optimization and efficient resource allocation. 

### Business Goals:
The company needs a data-driven approach to answer these questions and identify trends to:

- Optimize their inventory and staffing based on high and low demand periods.
- Enhance their product offerings by focusing on high-selling pizzas.
- Create targeted marketing strategies around peak sales periods and best-selling products.
- Improve overall sales and profitability by focusing on underperforming areas.

### Solution:
This project addresses the problem by analyzing the pizza sales data over a year, providing detailed insights into sales trends, best-selling pizzas, and customer preferences. The Power BI visualizations offer actionable intelligence, helping the pizza chain improve its operations, product offerings, and marketing strategies to enhance profitability.
